                    <h3><p> About Me.</p></h3>
                    <p>My name is Maddie and I am currently a student of Graphic Design at Algonquin College.</p> 
        
                    <p> Through my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in design principles and have gained experience with a variety of design tools, including Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign), Figma, and Sketch.</p>
        
                    <p>I am passionate about typography, layout design, and branding. I have also had the opportunity to experiment with other areas of design, such as motion graphics and web design.</p>
